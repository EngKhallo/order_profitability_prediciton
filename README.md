<h1 align="center">ðŸ“¦ Order Profitability Prediction ðŸ“Š</h1>

Welcome to the Order Profitability Prediction project! This project aims to build machine learning models to predict the profitability of orders in a supply chain dataset. By leveraging various regression techniques, we strive to understand and forecast the financial performance of individual orders based on several key features. ðŸš€

<h3>Features</h3>
<h5>- Data Preprocessing:</h5> Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.
<h5>- Feature Engineering:</h5> Selecting relevant features and creating new ones if necessary.
<h5>- Modeling:</h5> Implementing and evaluating Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression models.
<h5>- Visualization:</h5> Plotting actual vs. predicted values and feature importance to gain insights.
<h5>- Evaluation:</h5> Comparing models based on key metrics to select the best-performing one.
